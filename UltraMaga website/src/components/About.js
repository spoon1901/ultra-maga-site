          ULTRA $MAGA launched in January as a bold meme coin on the XRP Ledger. When momentum slowed and leadership vanished, the community didn't fold, it rallied.
          <br /><br />
          What followed wasn't a reboot, it was a grassroots resurgence. A small crew of holders stepped in, fueling a quiet rebuild with one mission: push $MAGA to where it always belonged.
          <br /><br />
          Today, $MAGA isn't just a meme, it's a signal. A movement. A message of strength and sovereignty that speaks far beyond borders.
          <br /><br />
          This isn't just about America anymore. It's about freedom for all. A global stand against control, and a rally cry for those who still believe in power to the people.
          <br /><br />
          Collaborations, airdrops, and utility are already in the works and some have already begun.
          <br /><br />
          This is holder-powered. Future-built. And just getting started.
